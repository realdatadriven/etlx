### ACTIONS

There are scenarios in ETL workflows where actions such as downloading, uploading, compressing or copying files cannot be performed using SQL alone. The `ACTIONS` section allows you to define steps for copying or transferring files using the file system or external protocols.

(See README for the full list of supported action types and examples.)
