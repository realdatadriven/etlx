### Exports

The `EXPORTS` section in the ETL configuration handles exporting data to files. This is particularly useful for generating reports for internal departments, regulators, partners, or saving processed data to a data lake. By leveraging DuckDB's ability to export data in various formats, this section supports file generation with flexibility and precision.
