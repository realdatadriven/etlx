### REQUIRES

The `REQUIRES` section in the ETL configuration allows you to load dependencies from external Markdown configurations. These dependencies can either be loaded from file paths or dynamically through queries. This feature promotes modularity and reusability by enabling you to define reusable parts of the configuration in separate files or queries.

(See README for full examples showing loading from queries and files.)
