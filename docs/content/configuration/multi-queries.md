### Multi-Queries

The `MULTI_QUERIES` section allows you to define multiple queries with similar structures and aggregate their results using a SQL `UNION`. This is particularly useful when generating summaries or reports that combine data from multiple queries into a single result set.

(See README for full examples and execution flow.)
