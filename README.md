# etlx
This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Framework powered by DuckDB, designed to seamlessly integrate and process data from diverse sources. It leverages Markdown as a configuration medium, where YAML blocks define metadata for each data source, and embedded SQL blocks specify the extraction, transformation, and loading logic.
